How long did you spend working on this project?

  I spent roughly 4 hours working on this project.

What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?

  The most rewarding challenge I conquered was, oddly enough, figuring out
  how to decrement the stock when a transaction occured.

What two additional features did you build? Why?
  1) A way for customers to return items, because it was suggested, and seems
  like a realistic feature.

  2) A way to get the total value of all transactions, because Toy City is all
  about raking in that dough.

Where do you still have room to grow?
  I am still not comfortable with Ruby. I think just coding more and more with
  it will help me become more familiar with the syntax and nuances of the
  language.
